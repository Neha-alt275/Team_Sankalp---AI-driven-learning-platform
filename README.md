# Team_Sankalp---AI-driven-learning-platform
Team Sankalp’s AI-powered study platform delivers personalized learning insights using student behavior and performance analysis. It offers adaptive quizzes, smart summaries, and focused revision strategies to improve concept retention, save study time, and boost exam readiness.

 **Overview** 
 
Sankalp StudyAI is an AI-powered study intelligence platform developed by Team Sankalp to help students learn smarter, revise efficiently, and prepare confidently for exams.
The platform analyzes a student’s study material, learning behavior, and performance data to deliver personalized learning insights, adaptive quizzes, and intelligent revision strategies.
Unlike traditional learning platforms, Sankalp StudyAI works with the student’s own content, ensuring a truly personalized and focused learning experience.

Recommend what to study, how to study, and when to revise

The platform acts as a personal AI study guide, promoting active learning and continuous improvement.
